        <dt>HTML</dt>
        <dd>HTML is the fundamental language for structuring web content. It defines the elements and layout of web pages, providing the basic building blocks for displaying content on the web.</dd>
      
        <dt>CSS </dt>
        <dd>CSS is used to style and format web content. It controls the presentation of web pages, including layout, colors, typography, and responsive design.</dd>
      
        <dt>JavaScript </dt>
        <dd>JavaScript is a versatile scripting language used for making web pages interactive. It allows for dynamic content, user interactions, and client-side functionality. In full-stack development, it's also used on the server-side (Node.js) to create dynamic web applications.</dd>
      
        <dt>Front-End Frameworks</dt>
        <dd>Front-end frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js are used for building the user interface of web applications. They enable developers to create interactive, dynamic, and responsive web pages.</dd>
      
        <dt>Back-End Frameworks</dt>
        <dd>Back-end frameworks like Node.js, Django, or Ruby on Rails provide server-side logic for web applications. They handle data processing, database interactions, and server-side operations.</dd>
      
        <dt>Database Management Systems</dt>
        <dd>Database systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB are used to store, manage, and retrieve data in web applications. They ensure data integrity, security, and efficient data handling.</dd>
      
        <dt>Version Control Systems</dt>
        <dd>Version control systems like Git help developers track changes to code, collaborate with teams, and manage different code versions. Git is often used in conjunction with platforms like GitHub or GitLab.</dd>
      
        <dt>APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)</dt>
        <dd>APIs enable communication between different software components. Web APIs, such as REST or GraphQL, allow web applications to fetch data from external sources or provide services to other applications.</dd>
      
        <dt>Containerization and Orchestration</dt>
        <dd>Technologies like Docker and Kubernetes help manage and deploy web applications in isolated containers, making it easier to scale and maintain complex systems.</dd>
      
        <dt>Web Servers</dt>
        <dd>Web servers like Apache, Nginx, or Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) handle HTTP requests, routing them to the appropriate resources and managing security and performance.</dd>
      
        <dt>Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)</dt>
        <dd>CI/CD tools and pipelines, such as Jenkins, Travis CI, or CircleCI, automate the building, testing, and deployment of web applications, ensuring rapid and reliable releases.</dd>
      
        <dt>Authentication and Authorization</dt>
        <dd>Frameworks and services like OAuth, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), or Firebase Authentication help secure web applications by managing user authentication and authorization.</dd>
